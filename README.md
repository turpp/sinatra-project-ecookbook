# Phase-2-Sinatra-Project
The Movie Selector is a CLI Application that is design to allow a user to quickly view and find out more information on movies from TMDB. 

EcookBook is a web application built with the Sinatra framework and bootstrap for styling. This applicatiokn is designed to be a place users can store recipes and find new recipes from other users.

Users can do all the basic CRUD actions. The application prevents users from editing or deleting recipes that do not belong to them. Also you must be logged in to create a new recipe

There are two extra features on the application. That users can access at anytime. 
 Cookmode- allows users to view recipes in checklist style for easy cooking. 
 Surprise- gives the user a random recipe.

To use the application follow the nav bar at the top or the buttons in the page. If you go somewhere that you are not suppose to be the application will notfiy you and point you to the right direction.
